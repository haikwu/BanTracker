# BanTracker
A simple discord bot that tracks bans on Hypixel using their API

## Usage
Put your token in config.json and simply add the bot to your server and run the /subscribe command in the channel you want the bans to be logged in.

Example:
``` json
{
    "channels": [1234567890, 0987654321],
    "token": "REALTOKEN"
}
```

## Disclaimer
I cleaned this up in like 30 minutes it's pretty bad.
